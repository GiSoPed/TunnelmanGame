# Tunnelman Video Game
Implements inheritance and polymorphism, the breadth-first search algorithm, and object-oriented programming to create a video game in C++. The objective of the game is for the player to dig through an oil field and find hidden barrels of oil while being chased by protesters. The player can collect items from the field, squirt the protesters with water, and bribe protesters to increase their score.
Our task was to implement multiple classes within the Actors and StudentWorld files.
